Windows key logger

Hi! i am Aditya Pandey , I created this key logger using python and then coverted the python file into an executeable using nuitka, i created this key logger as a standalone and onefile and it works on both Windows 10 and Windows 11 , it starts silently without any prompt or window 

How to make it work (in 5 steps)

STEP 1:- Download the main.exe file , and allow the browser to download the file (if asked),you can the file whatever you want afterwards.\n
STEP 2:- Run the file.\n
STEP 3:- Allow the file to run if Blocked by Windows Defender.(Run the file Again)\n
STEP 4:- A log.txt file will be created where the file was downloaded.\n
STEP 5:- NOW you can type anything on your keyboard , EVERYTHING will be LOGGED in this file with TIMESTAMPS.\n
